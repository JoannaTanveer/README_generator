### Technologies
    
The technologies utilized in this application are as follows: inquirer, Instant Markdown by David Bankier, and screencastify.

- Instant Markdown by David Bankier was used because This VSC extension opens a live localhost in the browers so that you can make changes to your .md file and see them real time.. 
- screencastify was used because Screencastify is an online application that aids the dev to record their local screen to demonstrate the functionality of a program, which is especially useful with node.js applications that do not have a flashy browser type output..
